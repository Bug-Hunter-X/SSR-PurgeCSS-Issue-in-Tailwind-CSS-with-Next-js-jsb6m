The solution involves correctly configuring PurgeCSS to include the necessary styles, even those used only on the server.  This usually entails specifying the paths to relevant files or using more inclusive patterns within your PurgeCSS configuration.  In this case, the solution involved adjusting the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` to include the server-side rendered components.  Here's an example:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: {
    content: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js', './pages/**/*.jsx', './components/**/*.jsx'],
    // ... other configuration
  },
  // ... rest of tailwind config
}
```

By explicitly defining the paths to all relevant components including server-side components (e.g., pages directory), PurgeCSS can correctly identify and retain the required styles. Alternatively, you could consider a more inclusive approach to avoid the risk of accidentally omitting needed classes.
