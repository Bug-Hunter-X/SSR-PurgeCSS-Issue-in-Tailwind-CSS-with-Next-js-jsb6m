This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue arises when Tailwind's purge process, designed to remove unused CSS classes, doesn't correctly identify classes used in components rendered on the server.  This results in these classes being removed from the final CSS bundle, causing components to appear broken or styled incorrectly on the client-side.  The problem often manifests as missing styles, unexpected styling, or layout issues that are only present after the initial page load.
